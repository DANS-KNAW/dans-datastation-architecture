Migration from EASY
===================

[EASY]{:target=_blank} (Electronic Archiving SYstem) is the legacy repository system of DANS. It was created in 2007 and has been
operational for over 15 years. It has the [Core Trust Seal (CTS)].We are currently in the process of migrating all datasets from
EASY to the Data Stations and/or the DANS Data Vault.

For the current status of the migration, contact the [Data Station Manager]{:target=_blank} of the Data Station you are interested
in.
