DataverseNL
===========

The differences between DataverseNL and the Data Stations are mainly contractual and organisational. In DataverseNL, the
customer organization is responsible for the curation of datasets. The technical differences are minimal:

* DataverseNL has been configured with multiple collections, each of which is administered by a customer organization. The Data Stations have a single
  collection per Data Station, which is administered by DANS.
* DataverseNL has no SWORD2 service.
