Mirroring to EASY
=================

Until a Data Station obtains the [Core Trust Seal]{:target=_blank} (CTS), it will mirror all deposited dataset
to [EASY](./migration.md), thus ensuring that these datasets are stored in a trusted repository. This temporary
configuration swaps out the Transfer Server for the EASY server.
