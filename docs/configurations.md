Configurations
==============

The [Data Station architecture](./datastation.md) gives a view of the components of one Data Station. Compare it a slice
in the [core services diagram](./core-services.md), including the Data Vault at the core. As stated before, there are
two slices in this diagram that are not Data Stations, but can be viewed as variations on&mdash;or different
configurations of&mdash;the Data Station architecture. Apart from these, there is a temporary configuration that will 
be used during the migration of datasets from the legacy repository system EASY to the Data Stations and the Data Vault.

Details about the various configurations can be found in the following sections:

* [DataverseNL](./dataversenl.md)
* [Vault as a Service](./vaas.md)
* [Mirroring to EASY](./easy-mirror.md)
