Configurations
==============

The [Data Station architecture](./datastation.md) gives a view of the components of one Data Station. Compare it to a slice in
the [core services diagram](./core-services.md), including the Data Vault at the core. As stated before, there are two slices in this diagram that are not Data
Stations, but can be viewed as variations on&mdash;or different configurations of&mdash;the Data Station architecture. Apart from these, there is a temporary
configuration that will be used until the Data Vault is fully operational.

Details about the various configurations can be found in the following sections:

* [DataverseNL](./dataversenl.md)
* [Vault as a Service](./vaas.md)
* [Temporary Vault](./temporary-vault-config.md)
