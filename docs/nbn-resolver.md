NBN Resolver
============

The NBN resolver service is operated by the [Koninklijke Bibliotheek]{:target=_blank}. It resolves NBN persistent identifiers to their current location. The
resolver is hosted at <https://persistent-identifier.nl/>{:target=_blank}.

The DANS Data Vault registers the long-term preservation copies of datasets with the NBN resolver through its [API]{:target=_blank}.
